Advent of Code 2025, Day 09

We have a list of coordinates. The coordinates correspond to locations of *red tiles*. In part 1, we want to find the area of the largest rectangle that can be created by using two of the red tiles as corners.

To find it, we can simply check all pairs of points, compute the area of the rectangle they span, and maintain the maximum.

For part 2, we still want to maximize the area of a rectangle spanned by two red tiles, but we have more restrictions now. Namely, if we connect the tiles in the given order, we see that they form a polygon with axis-aligned edges. We now want to find the largest rectangle that is fully contained in this polygon. Clearly, the rectangle we found in part 1 is no longer allowed, because it exits the polygon.

The simplest approach is still based on checking all pairs of red tiles. To see whether we exit the polygon, we can use another for-loop that checks if any of the polygon's edges intersects with any of the rectangle's edges.  This has a cubic time complexity and runs in about 14 seconds on my machine.
